The date marked for the event shall be June 11th, and the expected attire will be whatever your non-pulsating heart desires. Well, whatever isn't stained or smells of a dirt nap. Leave your attitude, weaponry, and disciplines at the gate, unless you would like a private interview with our esteemed Sheriff.       The halls of Elysium will be that of Madison Square Garden. Be sure to be there my lovely fresh bloods and see all that our family has to offer.     Je vous envoie mes amicales pens√©es,    Davinia"

Her prescription can be refilled at the pharmacy on the corner of Melrose and E 156th St if she ever runs out or is low.  I hope you and Ms. Lopez have a lovely afternoon.        Sincerely,      RNP Susanna Crawford"
