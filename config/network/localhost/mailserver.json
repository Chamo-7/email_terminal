        "body": "Hello Mayhew:  Just wanted to put in writing the courier work I discussed with you before your departure.  The package loaded aboard the merchant vessel you were purchased passage on will be need to be brought to the world of Adhara (0609). Once there you will have to establish contact with one Bah'ran Selkz -- a local antiques dealer and modern archaeologist (no degree backs this latter title) -- and exchange the package for an item of interest he holds. Once you have retrieved the item, immedieately return it to Drinax post-haste.    An account has already been established for the automatic payments meant for your hired merceneary cohort. I entrust you to the right judgement calls towards their usage on any problems that may pop up. As always, stay safe, my sources say that Selkz is a jumpy man and his status with the authorities on Adhara are not the best.     Glory to Drinax,    Her Royal Highness of the Sindalian Empire in Exile Princess Rao of Drinax"
