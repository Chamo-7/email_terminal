        "body": "Hello Mayhew:  Just wanted to put in writing the courier work I discussed with you before your departure.  The package loaded aboard the merchant vessel you were purchased passage on will be need to be brought to the world of Adhara (0609). Once there you will have to establish contact with one Bah'ran Selkz -- a local antiques dealer and modern archaeologist (no degree backs this latter title) -- and exchange the package for an item of interest he holds. Once you have retrieved the item, immedieately return it to Drinax post-haste.    An account has already been established for the automatic payments meant for your hired merceneary cohort. I entrust you to the right judgement calls towards their usage on any problems that may pop up. As always, stay safe, my sources say that Selkz is a jumpy man and his status with the authorities on Adhara are not the best.     Glory to Drinax,    Her Royal Highness of the Sindalian Empire in Exile Princess Rao of Drinax"

You will no longer be able to withdraw any further funds or assets from it until you meet and maintain requirements outlined by your father. The specifics of these requirements have been determined to be best discussed in-person at our offices.     Your father also requested the forwarding of the following message:       'Son, what the hell do you think you're doing out there in space? Galivanting around like it's some sort of playground? You need to come to your senses and start acting like a responsible adult.      I've had enough of your antics. You need to come back home and start working at the shipyard. You can't just waste your life away chasing after your ridiculous dreams. You need to start taking responsibility for your future and start making something of yourself.     If you don't come back home and start working, then you can forget about ever seeing a cent from my will or having access to your trust. You need to start taking this seriously, son. The world doesn't owe you a damn thing, and it's about time you realized that.       So, pack your bags and come home. It's time to start making a real contribution to society and start building a future for yourself. Don't make me repeat myself.'      We at Clinton & Associates look forward to further correspondance in the future.            Sincerely,       Blake Clinton      Clinton & Associates"
